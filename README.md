# CLOUD MACHINE

![Tifa](images/Tifa.png)

## "I'm selling these fine leather jackets."

## Preamble

_CLOUD MACHINE_ is a light, softcore NSFW overhaul of _Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade_ for _Steam,_ featuring high poly, fully nude lady characters and a revamp of the difficulty for a more engaging experience. A clothed variant is available because -- c'mon, even I can accept that it's a litte absurd.

### Requirements

- [Nexus Account](https://nexusmods.com/)

This account is mandatory, it must be created before continuing. _Nexus Free_ is probably adequate because the modlist is minimal in size.


## Installation

###  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

The _Microsoft Visual C++_ redistributable package is required for _Mod Organizer 2_ and you can download it from _Microsoft._ Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019" [here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

###  Steam Config

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

To ensure that _Steam_ does not automatically update, open the Properties window of _Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade_ in _Steam_, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_.

**Do Not Use Any Part of This List in a Protected Folder**

This includes `Program Files,` `Program Files (x86)`, `Downloads`, `Documents`, the `Desktop` or any other folders that _Windows_ considers "Protected" (essential to the operating system). If the _Wabbajack_ folder, the _Skyrim Special Edition_ folder, the _Steam_ folder, the modlist folder or the downloads folder are in any of these directories, the modlist will not function properly. Relocate offending folders to a non-Protected location such as the root directory. (D:\ for example.)

**Make Exceptions for Anti-Malware Programs**

Exclude antivirus and anti-malware programs from monitoring three directories: those containing the _Wabbajack_ app, the _Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade_ game folder, and the directory in which you wish to install the modlist. The list will not install or run properly otherwise. Particularly intrusive malware solutions such as _Bitdefender_ and _Webroot_ must be fully uninstalled due to technical limitations. Unfortunately, _Windows Defender_ is the only recommended antimalware solution one should use with _Wabbajack._
 
##  Using Wabbajack

Login to _Nexus_ with the _Wabbajack_ app. This login can be found by clicking the **GEAR** icon in the top right. It will toggle over to "logged in" when successful.

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where _Wabbajack_ will produce an error. Re-run _Wabbajack_ before seeking assistance. _Wabbajack_ will only download and reinstall the bare minimum necessary to get the modlist working. 

**Could not download x:**

Some Internet providers have difficulty accessing the servers which host the files comprising the list. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) with a terminus set to the United States. Free options include _ProtonVPN_ and _Cloudflare WARP._ If a download gets interrupted, delete all corrupt local copies before trying again.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

_CLOUD MACHINE_ will not work with anything but a legitimate copy of _Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade_ purchased on _Steam._ If you own the game on _Steam,_ go back to the Installation step. If this still doesn't work, ensure that you are not running Wabbajack as an Administrator. **Asking for help with pirated copies of the game will get you banned from Discord Support.**

## Post-Installation

### Launching the Modlist

Launch _ModOrganizer.exe_ from the directory in which you installed the list. Launch the game from the **FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE** entry in the drop-down menu.

That's it! No cringey MCM's or post-launch configuration like those **OTHER** _horrible_ games.

## Updating the Modlist

Download the modlist's `.wabbajack` file again and specify the same directories. _Wabbajack_ will only update what has changed, it will not repeat the entire installation. 

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _CLOUD MACHINE_ folder.
